## Daily Deals - What is it? 
Websites such as Groupon, NuDeal, AmigoAmigo and more are tremendously popular. They offer (local) activities and products with a lot of discount. Unfortunately, these companies often work with a sign up two hours in advance principle and/or you need to take the printed coupon with you. This makes it less accessible to tourists or people who just want to do something nice right NOW. This app is the solution. Based on your preferences of what you would like to do (activities, food, shopping, party etc.) it finds activities and deals you can immediately visit or do. Only deals for that day are available. Now you know where to go and what to do for a cheap price. 

Another benefit DailyDeals offers in comparison to sites as Groupon is that companies don't pay a high precentage of there income just to advertise. They also can upload a deal immediately and enjoy all benefits the minute they post their special offer because deals and discounts are being added by companies themselves. Every company can sign up and start adding specials deals. These discount deals boost the amount of clients visiting your company. Just select the location, a time slot and the discount deal. So when a restaurant has a quiet Monday evening, they can just log in to the app, enter a deal (such as second main course for free) and wait for the costumers to come!

## Design - How does the app work? 
How is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes and how they relate.

## Process - Which decisions were made?
Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.

Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?
