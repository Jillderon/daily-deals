# DailyDeals #
Final Project Minor Programming of Jill de Ron

## Goal of the app: ##
Websites such as Groupon, NuDeal, AmigoAmigo are tremendously popular. They offer (local) activities and products with a lot of discount. Unfortunately, these companies often work with a reserve two hours in advance principle and/or you need to take the printed coupon with you. This makes it less accessible to tourists or people who just want to do something nice right NOW. This app is the solution. Based on your preferences of what you would like to do (activities, food, shopping, party etc.) it finds activities and deals you can immediately visit or do. Only deals for that day are available. Now you know where to go and what to do for a cheap price.

Another benefit DailyDeals offers in comparison to sites as Groupon is that companies don't pay a high percentage of their income just to advertise their deal on the website. Every company can sign up and start adding specials deals. They can upload a deal immediately and enjoy all benefits the minute they post their special offer because deals and discounts are being added by companies themselves. These discount deals boost the amount of clients visiting your company. Just select the location, a time slot and the discount deal. So when a restaurant has a quiet Monday evening, they can just log in to the app, enter a deal (such as second main course for free) and wait for the costumers to come!
