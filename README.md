## Goal of the app: ##
Websites such as Groupon, NuDeal, AmigoAmigo and more are tremendously popular. They offer (local) activities and products with a lot of discount. Unfortunately, these companies often work with a sign up two hours in advance principle and/or you need to take the printed coupon with you. This makes it less accessible to tourists. Another website that targets both tourist and citizen of Amsterdam is IAmsterdam. It includes a cultural agenda of all there is to do in Amsterdam. Sadly, this does not comes with an app or special discount deals. This app aims to combine the best of both worlds. Based on your preferences of what you would like to do (activities, having dinner, museums, shopping, theater, party) it finds activities and deals you can immediately visit or do. Only deals for that day are available. Just click on ‘Get this deal’ and there will be a place reserved for you. 

Deals and discounts are being added by companies. Every company can sign up and start adding specials deals. This discount deals boost the amount of clients visiting your company. Just select the location, a time slot, maximum capacity and the discount deal. So when a restaurant has a quiet Monday evening, they can just log in to the app, enter a deal (such as second main course for free) and wait for the costumers to come! 

## Possible limitations ##
The result of a search are shown as pins on a map of Amsterdam. There are probably some difficulties with loading the pins on the map, because it has to be close to the current location of the user. And the user can navigate, zoom-in and zoom-out, still displaying and updating all the pins on the map. 

## Possible extensions ##
It would be nice if a company can already schedule upcoming deals in their calendar. And the deal will be made available for clients the day the company wants to. 

## Components used ##
* To visualize activities as marking points on a map of Amsterdam, one internal (built-in) component is used: Map Kit Framework 
* To subsribe users Firebase will be used. 

## Similar application ##
A similar application is the WeCity app. WeCity uses a specially designed algorithm to deliver tailored travel tips and recommendations. But it doesn't show (temporary) deals and as a business you can't add your company as an interesting activity!

## Design so far
